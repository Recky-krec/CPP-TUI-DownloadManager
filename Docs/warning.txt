There's basically only one thing to keep in mind when using C++ instead of C when interfacing libcurl:

The callbacks CANNOT be non-static class member functions

Example C++ code:

class AClass {
    static size_t write_data(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb,
                             void *ourpointer)
    {
      /* do what you want with the data */
    }
 }
